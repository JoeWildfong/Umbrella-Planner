# Umbrella-Planner

This project provides an easy planning interface for coordinating movements in an umbrella filming project.

It simulates an overhead view of a grid of people carrying umbrellas and allows you to specify who should have their umbrellas open or closed at any point in time.

Designed to be used in conjunction with my Umbrella-Script app, which presents information on when to open and close umbrellas to the participants in an easy-to-follow way.
